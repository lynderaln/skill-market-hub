# Skill Market Hub 🚀  

**Skill Market Hub** is a platform designed to connect people with skills (art, tech, crafts, tutoring, etc.) to those who need them. The goal is to empower **youth, freelancers, and small businesses** by giving them visibility and opportunities to earn from their talents.

## 🌍 Why Skill Market Hub?  
- ✔️ Many skilled individuals struggle to find opportunities.  
- ✔️ Small businesses lack affordable ways to hire the right talent.  
- ✔️ A single hub where skills meet opportunities can transform lives.

## 💡 Features (Planned)  
- User profiles for showcasing skills.  
- Search & filter system for finding talent.  
- Sponsor/partner support to grow the community.  
- Opportunities for businesses, individuals, and organizations.

- Development tools & integrations  
- Marketing & outreach  

**Sponsors will receive recognition** on the platform (logo placement, mentions) and across social channels.
